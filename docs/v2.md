1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deckhouse/nimble_exporter.git
cd nimble_exporter
```

2. Build the Binary

If you want to build the nimble_exporter binary from the source, you'll need to have Go installed on your machine. Then, you can build the binary using:

```bash
go build -o nimble_exporter
```

3. Running the Exporter

You can run the exporter using the built binary. The exporter needs to be configured to connect to your HPE Nimble Storage array. You can do this by setting environment variables or using a configuration file.

```bash
./nimble_exporter --nimble.host=<NIMBLE_HOST> --nimble.username=<USERNAME> --nimble.password=<PASSWORD>
```

4. Accessing Metrics

After deployment, you can access the metrics at `http://<EXPORTER_IP>:9100/metrics`. These metrics can then be visualized using Prometheus or Grafana.
